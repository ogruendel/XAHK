## Next Phase - Release 1.0

Multi Instant Opperation<br>
Bug Fixes<br>

## Platform Support
Although Minecraft runs on multiple platforms, this software requires AutoHotkey, which supports *Windows only*.

Linux players may find an alternative by using a [shell script](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/bu4gka/linux_autoclicker_bash_script_useful_for_afk/).

Mac players can use macOS's built-in accessibiltiy features and a full-size keyboard with a numeric keypad:
1. Open System Preferences.
2. Go to Accessibility → Pointer Control → Alternate Control Methods and enable "Mouse Keys".
3. In Minecraft, position your avatar for the activity (fishing, for example) and press ⌃5️⃣ (control+5, on the numpad) to send a "right click".
4. Now tap 0️⃣ (on the numpad) to simulate "hold right click"; note that you cannot switch applications as with XAHK.
